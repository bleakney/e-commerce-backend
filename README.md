  ## Description

  This project was to build an E-Commerce Backend that could be used to retrieve, update, add, and delete data from a database.

  ## Installation

  Run "npm install" from the root directory.
  
  ## Usage
  You can use the database locally with mysql by opening mysql from the terminal and entering "source db/schema.sql", then exiting mysql and entering "npm run seed" to seed that database if you would like to use the pregenerated data included in this project. After that, simply start the server with "npm start".
